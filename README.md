## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ I am a mixed-methods/ heavy quantitative UX researcher with 10+ years of industry experience. I bring a unique perspective to my work with a multi-disciplinary approach from the hard sciences, computational social science, and deep expertise in statistical analysis. My specialties include: data triangulation (attitude, behavior, cognition), UX metric generation, dashboard creation, modeling ROI, and behavioral segmentation.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning through CalTech's AI/ML bootcamp and hope to apply this to UX-related problems in industry. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that apply machine learning algorithms and how I might take new tools and adapt them to solve for customer-centric problems.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with crafting concise and elegant code, tips on how I can approach problems from different angles, and any help in terms of what would "uplevel" my portfolio.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to user research, digital media, advertising, or SaaS!


- âš¡ Fun fact: I am obsessed with dogs and combat sports.
